She is selfless and self-depreciating as she thinks lowly of herself and values other peopleâ€™s happiness more than her own. Nagisa is naive and optimistic, as she always sees the good in everyone. In After Story, she is noted to be smart and diligent by the manager of the restaurant she is working in.'
